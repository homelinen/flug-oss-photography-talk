## Curves/Exposure and Sharpness ##

### Curves ###

* Represent the light levels in an image
* Very flexible in editing
* Specific control at different light levels
* Generally seperate R,G,B channels

### Exposure ###

How long the shutter was open. The longer it's open the brighter the image.

What if it's open too long or not long enough?

### Sharpness ###

Detail in an image. Many factors:

* exposure
* movement (Movment causes blurring)
* ISO (Look into this)
* Sensor and Lens faults
