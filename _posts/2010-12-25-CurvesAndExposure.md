<h2>Curves/Exposure and Sharpness</h2>

<h3>Curves</h3>
[A picture of a Curve]()

* 

<h3>Exposure</h3>

How long the shutter was open. The longer it's open the brighter the image.

What if it's open too long or not long enough?

<h3>Sharpness</h3>

Detail in an image. Many factors:

* exposure
* movement (Movment causes blurring)
* ISO (Look into this)
* Sensor and Lens faults
