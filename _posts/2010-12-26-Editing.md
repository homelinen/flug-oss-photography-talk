## Editing ##

Not always possible to get the perfect picture in the field.

* _RAW_ images provide more data to work with in editing.
* Normally only the exposure or contrast may need editing.
* Curves can give more control over a photo
* RAW photos need to be converted to JPEG/TIFF for distribution (More convenient)
