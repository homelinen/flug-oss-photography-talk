## FFMPEG/Timelapse ##

A Time Lapse is a series of photos played one after the other to create a video. 

Normally taken over a long period of time.

One solution is ffmpeg:
    ffmpeg -i %03d.jpg -r 15 -croptop 180 -cropbottom 180 -s hd1080 -vcodec libx264 -vpre hq -crf 16 video_1080.mp4

There are plenty of programs that will do the same thing more intuitively.
