### GIMP

The GIMP is useful for more in depth, heavier editing. Like removing stains on the lens or getting the perfect lighting. The other programs are for quickly getting through large batches of photographs where GIMP and Photoshop are, in my opinion, more for editing individual photos to perfection.
