## Jekyll & Deck.js ##

A base for a Jekyll generated deck.js site (Do a few things very horribly)

### Usage ###

Slides go in `_posts` and are ordered by newest first. (This is a nasty hack before I implement a proper generator and slides folder) 

### Credits ###

[Jekyll Base](https://github.com/danielmcgraw/Jekyll-Base) - For the nice usable base for the site
[Deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) - For the lovely HTML5 presentation tool
